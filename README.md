# ESP32-ARP-Spoof.mpy-by-Tanjib
ARP spoofing attack targets a wireless network, it could: Intercept unencrypted traffic within the SSID. Cause connectivity issues for the victim device, affecting their ability to access the internet.A flood of ARP packets may cause the victim device to continuously update its ARP table, leading to: Misrouted packets (redirected to the attacker). 
Sending 500 packets rapidly might trigger intrusion detection systems (IDS) or raise anomalies in ARP logs. A stealthier approach would involve sending ARP packets at intervals to mimic normal behavior.
4. Scope of Damage:
If targeting a single victim, the attack might not significantly impact the network as a whole.
If scaled across multiple devices (e.g., by targeting the broadcast address or multiple ARP tables), it can disrupt network communication entirely, resembling a DoS attack.
Network Topology and Security: On unprotected networks (e.g., no DAI, static ARP, or port security), this attack can be highly effective.
Note- You can use this arp spoof before MitM attack; you can use MitM when ARP Spoof running. And yes!, use slow ARP poisoning to avoid detection & pair it with DNS spoofing or SSL stripping to maximize data capture.
